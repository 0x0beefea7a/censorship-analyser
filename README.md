censorship-analyser
===================

Tor is documented to be blocked in several countries. Analyzing these censorship incidents can be a tedious task; especially without access to machines inside the censoring networks. To make analysis easier, it would be great to have a lightweight analysis tool which can be run by censored users. This tool would conduct a number of networking tests and figure out if and how Tor could be blocked. The tool's final report should then somehow make it back to the Tor project. 

A research paper describing the theory behind this project can be found at http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/pdf/foci2013.pdf
